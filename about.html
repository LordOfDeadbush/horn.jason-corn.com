        <p>
            I am currently studying at Santa Clara University with a 
            double major in Music and Electrical Engineering. I also have
            a background in software engineering from studying at Foothill
            College. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been studying French Horn for 10 years, most of which I
            have played extensively with various orchestral, band and jazz groups. 
            I also have a large amount of experience with solo repitoire for horn, 
            including low horn and jazz horn. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been studying Trumpet for 5 years, with an emphasis in band repitoire. 
            I also have experience with jazz trumpet. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As a high school graduate of the area, I have been very active in
            music performance in the area. Academically, I have been performing Horn 
            with the SCU Wind Ensemble. I have also been a proud member of the SCU Bronco
            Pep Band, and am proud to be a member of the first band to perform live at a SF
            Giants game!
            This past spring, I also had the fantastic opportunity to perform with the 
            Intercollegiate Band at the CBDNA West-Northwest conefrence.
        </p>
        <!-- past groups -->
        <p>
            Along with my work at school, I have also been a member of various community groups. 
            Currently, I am working with Los Altos' Ye Olde Towne Band as one of their 2nd trumpet players. 
            In the past I have also played with the De Anza performing arts department as a horn player.
